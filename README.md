# angular-playground

Just a simple angular single page application that utilized browserify and gulp.

First time exploring Angular, it is quite complex compared to Vue.js. In my personal view, I prefer Vue.js because of its simplicity.

To explore this repo:

1. `gulp setup` to build css and js for the first time
2. `gulp run` to setup a webserver. View the app at `http://localhost:8000

To develop
1. `gulp dev` will watch files changes and run a webserver
